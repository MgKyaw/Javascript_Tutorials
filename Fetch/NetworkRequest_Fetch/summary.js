// A typical fetch request consists of two await calls:

let response = await fetch(url, options); // resolves with response headers
let result = await response.json(); // read body as json

// Or, without await:

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(result => console.log("result"))

// Response properties:

// response.status – HTTP code of the response,
// response.ok – true if the status is 200-299.
// response.headers – Map-like object with HTTP headers.
// Methods to get response body:

// response.text() – return the response as text,
// response.json() – parse the response as JSON object,
// response.formData() – return the response as FormData object (multipart/form-data encoding, see the next chapter),
// response.blob() – return the response as Blob (binary data with type),
// response.arrayBuffer() – return the response as ArrayBuffer (low-level binary data),
// Fetch options so far:

// method – HTTP-method,
// headers – an object with request headers (not any header is allowed),
// body – the data to send (request body) as string, FormData, BufferSource, Blob or UrlSearchParams object.
